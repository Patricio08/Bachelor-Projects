# Operating Systems projects

In this course it was studied:

1. The operating system as an extended but simplified abstraction of the hardware and a manager for resources access.
2. Study of the management of physical and virtual memory, with emphasis on the following topics: mechanisms of paging and segmentation; virtual memory; working sets; replacement policies.
3. Management of processes and threads. States and execution context. Implementation aspects: context switching; blocking queues.
4. Concurrent programming: synchronization and mutual exclusion: event; semaphore; mutex; deadlock and starvation; algorithms parallelization.
5. Thread scheduling: static and dynamic priorities: scheduling criteria for client and server platforms.
6. Study of input/output with emphasis on the following topics: synchronous and asynchronous operations on I/O devices; communication via sockets.; use of asynchronous I/O in building scalable concurrent servers.
